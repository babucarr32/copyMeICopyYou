## Introduction:

**CopyMeICopyYou** is a terminal-based tool designed to facilitate clipboard sharing between two computers. With this utility, you can effortlessly copy text from one computer and paste it on another, and vice versa. Whether you're averse to complex scripts and setups or a tech-savvy enthusiast, we've got you covered.

This repository offers different flavors of the tool to enhance your clipboard-sharing experience:

1. The repo contains a folder called **linux**, which includes the Linux executable.
2. The repo contains a folder called **windows**, which includes the Windows executable.
3. At the root of the repo, you can access the source code used to build this versatile clipboard-sharing tool.

## Requirements:

To ensure smooth operation of this terminal-based tool, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Python**: If you intend to run the provided scripts (not executables).
2. **Xclip** (Linux Only): To use this tool on Linux, install Xclip. You can do this by running the following command: `sudo apt-get install xclip`.
3. **Pyperclip**: Install Pyperclip using the command `pip install pyperclip`.
